Physarum
========

This is the documentation for physarum, a little python-package that runs physarum simulations, mainly for artistic purposes.
It's meant to be used interactively from a jupyter notebook, as demonstrated under examples. 

Physarum is a type of slime mold, that, although it is organized quite simple, is able to solve remarkably complex tasks.
